# Use the MATLAB mission planning tools (PLINE plot in MCC) and the OFLS
# Constraints to ensure that the spacecraft is at a forward sun pitch attitude
# for sufficient time to pre-warm both the RCS-2 and MUPS-2 propellant lines
# prior to maneuvering to a cold attitude. Required times for warm attitudes and
# time limits for cold attitudes are specified in the following table:

# 1. If an observation or group of observations belongs to one or more cold bins,
# select the left-most applicable (longest allowable) bin
# 
# 2. A short (< 5 minutes) attitude hold is allowable during the maneuver from
# the required warm attitude into the restricted pitch range. (Intermediate
# Attitude)
# 
# 3. Measures must be in place to transition automatically to Normal Sun Mode
# (NSM) if the mission schedule is stopped while the spacecraft attitude is
# within a restricted duration pitch range.
# 
# 4. Maneuvers within a pitch region are allowed as long as the total duration
# meets the requirements specified. The total duration is defined as the time
# from the start of the first attitude hold in a region until the time at which
# the sun pitch angle crosses out of the region (usually during a maneuver).
# 
# 5. Time during an eclipse must not be used to count toward the pre-heating
# requirement
